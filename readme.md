game-a Readme
=============

introduction
------------
game-a is a terminal-based game written in C using
the `curses` library. It is inspired by
[dwarf fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)
but probably won't ever reach that level of complexity.

It started out as
[semicircle/code/c/game.c](https://github.com/joshhartigan/semicircle/blob/master/code/c/game.c),
which grew out of hand since all the code was scruffily written in one file.
Now, the code will be scruffily written in multiple files!
